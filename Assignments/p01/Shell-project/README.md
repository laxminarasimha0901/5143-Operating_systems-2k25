## Overview
##### In this project, we implemented a basic shell using Python. Below, we have listed the assignment rubric which includes who worked on each command, and their completion status.

## Instructions
#### To run this shell, you must execute the following:
#### 1. Ensure access to the repository
#### 2. Switch over to the Files directory
#### 3. Type the command "python shell.py"
#### 
#### Now that the program is running, similarly use it to navigate the emulated terminal!

# Final Thoughts
### Highs and Lows
#### Jadyn
##### A low for me was realizing that I hardcoded the permissions instead of coding them to work simultaneously with the chmod. I coded the ls command before chmod and didn't take into account the changes that I needed to make to my code, until we were presenting in class. I'm glad I was able to get it fixed up and working. My high for this project was actually getting it done, and getting good feedback. I always have low expectations for myself when it comes to big projects like this, so I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish.
#### Andrew
##### Personally, the high for me is seeing the project actually executing correctly. I love seeing our project compile and run correctly after hours of hard work. The lows for me were piping and redirection. In all honesty, I never knew these were features to the linux terminal before this project was assigned. I took some time to watch youtube videos in order to fully understand how each of these worked, and planned how to integrate those ideas with the product we were creating. Piping alone took almost a week to finally conquer.
#### Soma
#### For me my low was, as a beginner to coding and making project was overwhelming and had kind of stress, how can I  make it work. But during the project I got to learn new topics and concepts of python. I have searched for the content online and watched some videos how the shell works and how each different command works as we go. But finally when the code was  working, it  gave a relief and high.

### What was good and bad?
#### Jadyn
##### I'm fairly new to working with both Python and Codespaces, so it was really annoying trying to navigate the usage of both throughout this project. Sometimes, me and the rest of the group would be working on the project simultaneously, and it would cause us to get merge errors when we were committing changes. Although I have used GitHub before, I wasn't the most familiar with all of the features, so it took some time to get around the errors I got while merging or committing. I think the good thing about working on this project was learning how to work with a group of people on a program, and how to create a tool that is so prevelent in both the industry and day to day life. In the past, I have not had the best time working with groups, so this was probably the first time I haven't had to do a majority of the work. I appreciated them so much for taking the time to get things done.
#### Andrew
##### In my opinion, this project was very good in the sense that teamwork was consistent all the way throughout. If a team member had problems with a part of code, others could be there to help give fresh perspectives on potential solutions. On the other hand, I believe that I could have started work on this project much sooner to better plan ideas on getting functions to work. Lastly, we had a few merge conflicts. In the future, I now know how to handle these if/when there were to occur again.
#### Soma
#### In my opinion, this project was a good as beginner to explore new things and learn new topics in python. And the team was always available whenever I had doubts and shared thoughts whenever I asked them during the development of this project. The bad thing about was we could have started a bit early and make sure everything was running smoothly and consistently. Some times we had conflicts with merging the code into repository. I, now understand that if we can start early we can improvise much more by utilising the time and make it more wonderful. 

### What would we do differently?
#### Jadyn
##### If I were to do this project again, I would definitely make sure we managed our work with the amount of time we had. I'm a big procrastinator on bigger assignments like this, and even though I got my commands done on time, I could have spaced the work I did over those weeks we had. I think if I would have managed my time better, I could have possibly added more details to our shell that would make it more unique when compared to our peers.
#### Andrew
##### I believe that, moving forward, having assigned roles more explicitly stated would most benefit the team. I think that this would help remove any kind of ambiguity to project specifications. Like Jadyn, I can procrastinate big assignments when due dates are far away, so getting started when information is most fresh would be extrememly beneficial. Also, not waiting to work on the project at 9pm would be much nicer on my sleep schedule!
#### Soma
#### If I could redo this project, I’d manage my time properly, to skip the last-minute rush and add some unique feature to our shell. Clearly defined roles would’ve kept everyone on the same page, no confusion. Procrastinating on big tasks is my habit, but starting early would’ve been smarter. Late-night 9pm coding sessions killed my sleep. Next time, I’ll plan better and keep things chill.
